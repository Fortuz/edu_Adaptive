    "In this exercise we will test different regularization parameters to better understand how regularization (penalty) works and how it can be used to prevent overfitting. Observe the changes in the decision boundary as the lamdba will be changed. With a small lambda you will notice that there is almost no error in the clustering, but in return you get a very complicated curve. This is not a good decision curve, notice that it accepts (-0.25; 1.5), which seems to be an incorrect decision based on our data set.\n",
